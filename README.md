# Disaster_Management_Machine_Learning
Our project aims to provide predictive analysis and early warning systems for natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, and wildfires. By leveraging machine learning models trained on historical and real-time data, we predict the occurrence of these events based on various environmental factors and parameters.
